#### Single-line Summary
**Today, _ and _ paired together. It took about _**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on creating the meta tags for the window
  2. Next, we added the hamburger menu, and eventually made it a button
  3. Then we went switched driver and went through the steps to get the behavior of the page to change based on the size of the device
    * Initially we had hidden the subheading for the main title of the banner, then re-added it back when it got to the size of a tablet and larger, then we found that it wasn't necessary to do so - ALL mobile devices will be identically formatted.
  4. Then we added styling for the changes when on a larger display
  5. Finally we adjusted the max width of the pictures in a window, by adding a img{ max-width: 100%;}
